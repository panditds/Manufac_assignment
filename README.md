## Wine Dataset Statistical Analysis

This project is a React application that performs statistical analysis on a wine dataset. It calculates class-wise statistics such as mean, median, and mode for the "Flavanoids" and "Gamma" properties of the dataset.

## Installation
1.To run this project, you need to have Node.js , Yarn and git / githubdesktop installed on your machine.

2.Clone this repository to your local machine:
### `git clone https://github.com/panditds/Manufac_assignment.git`

3.Navigate to the project directory
### `cd Manufac_assignment`

4.Install the project dependencies:
### `yarn insall`

5.Run the project using the following command:
### `yarn start`


# The application will display two tables:

The first table shows class-wise statistics for the "Flavanoids" property, including mean, median, and mode.
The second table shows class-wise statistics for the "Gamma" property, including mean, median, and mode.
